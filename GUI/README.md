Desktop app for controlling RoboButler 3000

## Instructions

The GUI starts off disconnected. To connect to either the Android or RasPi system, press 'c'.
Assuming the connection works, press 'i' to start trasmitting joystick data 5 times per second.

Press 'j' to switch the motor controller into power-on mode.

The virtual joystick can now be used to control the robot. You can control the virtual joystick in three ways:

* Pressing the up, down, left or right buttons
* Dragging the joystick control with the mouse.
* Using an attached PlayStation joystick. Axes 1 and 2 are mapped to the virtual joystick, which means up and down
  on the left stick controls forward movement, and left and right on the other stick controls steering.
