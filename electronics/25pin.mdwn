14 - +5V power for Raspberry Pi
15 - +5V power for USB Hub
16 - +5V power for IOIO and MBED
17 - Spare for extra power for IOIO if necessary

Note that whatever connects to the Android charges it, so the IOIO or the Raspberry Pi may need quite a bit of power.

25 - Ground (0V)
24 - Ground (0V)


13 - CANH
12 - CANL

11 - CAN switch relay
10 - Ignition switch
09 - Horn
08 - Light (shorts to ground when on)

## Potentially reserved pins

Ultrasound - 2 per sensor = 10 (01-?)

## Power usage

* IOIO and Mbed alone, with no phone attached: 190mA
* IOIO, MBed, mobile phone charging on maximum setting: 400mA

The phone charge current seems dependent on the cable used. It never seems to be much - 200mA probably isn't enough to keep the phone charged.

* Raspberry Pi, with Ciseco wireless module and Creative webcam - ~340mA
* As above, charging mobile phone - 550mA

So whether through the RasPi or IOIO, we only charge the phone with 200mA - which may not be enough.

Using the 4-port USB hub, the power consumption is 260mA, slightly better.
